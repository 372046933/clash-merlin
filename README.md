# clash-merlin
Configure clash on Merlin

Files are start/iptable script for clash on merlin.

Suppose lan-ip is 192.168.51.1, a clash binary is in directory /jffs and config.yaml specify 8887 as redir-port, fake-ip etc. Put the files in /jffs/scripts. Make your own adjustment accordingly.

Minimalism, no if/else in script, support both TCP/UDP. Have Fun!
